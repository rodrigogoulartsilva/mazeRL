# mazeRL

After participating on a Reinforcement Learning training day at the Open Data Science Conference in Boston, I decided to practice my RL skills by building the traditional mouse maze game in PyGame (my first ever experience with it) and using Epsilon Greedy Q Learning for learning.

1- Run maze.py using Python 3.7

2- Click on the "Start Training" button to see the mouse learning.

3- After some time the mouse learns how to get to the cheese by experimentation using Q Learning.

4- You can use the training data inside the "training_results" folder.

Built with Python 3.7 and pygame 2.1.2 on MacOS
